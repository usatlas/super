# Welcome to the **US ATLAS SUPER** page. 
<br>
### The US ATLAS Summer Undergraduate Program for Exceptional Researchers (SUPER) provides funding for exceptional undergraduate students in the US to work on ATLAS physics analysis, performance tools, detector and electronics R&D, core software and computing during the summer.
<br>
#### The program does not pair students with specific mentors or projects, but rather aims to fund students who, through their supervisors and colleagues, already have connections to the ATLAS experiment and are looking for summer research funding.
<br>
#### A funded SUPER student is required to work full-time for at least 8 weeks. Each award is expected to be for no more than $5,000, inclusive of any necessary overhead at the home institute. 
<br>
#### The award is nominally to be used for stipends for the student, but can also be used for travel to/from an ATC. Budgets containing extra requests are allowed, though these extra requests may not be funded. Selected awardees who have submitted the best two final reports will each be eligible for up to $1000 in funding to attend the 2021 US ATLAS meeting.
