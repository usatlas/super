# Welcome to the **US ATLAS SUPER** page. 
<br>
### The US ATLAS Summer Undergraduate Program for Exceptional Researchers (SUPER) provides funding for exceptional undergraduate students in the US to work on ATLAS physics analysis, performance tools, detector and electronics R&D, core software and computing during the summer.
<br>
#### The program provides a stipend for students who are looking for summer research and targets those who through their advisors and colleagues already have connections to the ATLAS experiment. We are exploring options to pay students directly to reduce paperwork overhead for applicants. 
<br>
#### Funded SUPER students are expected to work full-time on their proposed research project for at least 8 weeks in the summer. Each award will be for $5,500 in addition to support for travel if needed to be co-located with the mentor. Selected awardees will be asked to submit two reports and present at a symposium.
<br>
### **The call for proposals is now open! Proposal materials are due no later than February 10, 2023.** 
#### **See the [page on how to apply for instructions.]({{site.data.locations.howto}})**
