### The US ATLAS Summer Undergraduate Program for Exceptional Researchers (SUPER) provides funding for exceptional undergraduate students in the US to work on ATLAS physics analysis, performance tools, detector and electronics R&D, core software and computing during the summer.
<br>
#### The program does not pair students with specific mentors or projects, but rather provides a stipend for students who, through thier advisors and colleagues, already have connections to the ATLAS experiment and are looking for summer research.  The sipened will be paid directly to the student do not include any benefits. 
<br>
#### Funded SUPER students are expected to work full-time on their proposed research project for at least 8 weeks. Each award will be for no more than $6,000, inclusive of any additionaly costs required by the home institute.

#### The award is nominally to be used to provide a stipend for the student while they work on their summer research project, thought it may also be used for travel to/from an ATC. Budgets containing extra requests are allowed, though these extra requests may not be funded. Selected awardees who have submitted the best two final reports will be eligible for up to $1000 in funding to attend the 2021 US ATLAS meeting.
