>**Who should apply?**
>>The application should be submitted by the undergraduate requesting funding. This is typically done after discussion and iterating with a faculty mentor on campus, though please contact us if you are looking for a mentor and possible projects. Under Represented Minorities and students at Minority Serving Institutes are encouraged to apply.

>**What form should the applications take**
>>The application form is available at [this link (click on Application on the left)](https://indico.bnl.gov/event/14122/). It might be helpful for the undergraduate to iterate with their mentor before submitting the materials.

>**What will be the process by which the decisions are made?**
>>The proposals will be evaluated on a competitive basis by the US ATLAS Physics Support and Outreach coordinators after consulting with the rest of the US ATLAS Operations management team. Proposals will be evaluated in three areas: 1) The merit of the proposed research, 2) The ability of the student to achieve the proposed milestones, 3) A diversity component.

>**What is expected in the final report?**
>>The final report should be 3-4 pages, and include an explanation of the work that was achieved over the course of the summer. Background information should be included, including why the project was important, what obstacles were overcome during the research and prospectives for future work. Clearly labeled plots and tables of numbers with units are encouraged.

>**What is the maximum dollar amount for a given award?**
>>The amount awarded as a stipend is $5,000, paid directly to the student. Additional funds are available for travel, depending on need. 

>**What is the length of time for the project?**
>>The student is expected to dedicate at least 8 weeks to working on the proposed project. 

>**When will funding begin?**
>>The process to distribute funds to the students can start as soon as the student is available to carry out research full-time without taking any classes in the summer period.

>**What process will be used to distribute the funds?**
>>The stipends are expected to be paid directly to the student via direct deposit to their bank account.

>**Are students from non-US institutes eligible?**
>>No, the applicants must be enrolled at a US institute. The faculty mentor should be a member of US ATLAS.

>**Are non-US citizens eligible?**
>>Yes, as long as they are enrolled at a US institute.

>**Are current students who graduate before the summer eligible?**
>>We don't explicitly exclude recent graduates; however, the aim is to support current undergraduates. Recent graduates who submit a very strong application will be considered.

>**What sort of travel can be requested?**
>>Support for travel may be requested, for example if the student is not co-located with the faculty member to to travel to one of the ATCs or to a test beam in the US. Support for travel to CERN is discouraged, as are proposals to base SUPER students at CERN.

>**Can grants be combined with other sources of funding?**
>>Yes, we encourage faculty mentors to investigate support from their home institutions, as well as from their own grants
