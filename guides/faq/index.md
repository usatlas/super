title: Frequently Asked Questions
---

>**Who should apply?**
>>The proposal should be submitted by the undergraduate requesting funding after discussion and iterating with a faculty mentor on campus.

>**What form should the applications take**
>>A simple PDF is sufficient. If necessary, the proposals can be written in the form of a Letter of Intent, though the undergraduate should iterate with their mentor in all cases.

>**What will be the process by which the decisions are made?**
>>The proposals will be evaluated on a competitive basis by the US ATLAS Physics Support manager and Duputy Physics Support manager after consulting with the rest of the US ATLAS Operations management team. Proposals will be evaluated in three areas: 1) The merit of the proposed research, 2) The ability of the student to achieve the proposed milestones, 3) A diversity component

>**What will be the process by which the decisions about the travel award are made?**
>>The proposals will be evaluated on a competitive basis by the US ATLAS Physics Support manager and Duputy Physics Support manager after consulting with the rest of the US ATLAS Operations management team. Proposals will be evaluated in three areas, based on the final reports: 1) The merit of the achieved research, 2) The originality of the achieved research, 3) The quality of the written reports

>**What is expected in the final report?**
>>The final report should be at least 3 pages, and include an explanation of the work that was achieved over the course of the summer. Some background information, including why the project is important, what obstacles were overcome during the research and prospectives for future work should be included. Clearly labeled plots and tables of numbers with units are encouraged.

>**What is the maximum dollar amount for a given award?**
>>The maximum amount that can be requested for a standard proposal is $5,000. Variances from this amount are to be strictly limited to exceptional circumstances, but are still possible. Note that **this maximum includes overhead costs**, which should be clearly specified in the budget to be provided by the research mentor.

>**What is the length of time for the project?**
>>The requirement is for a student to work at least 8 weeks. Longer (summer) proposals can also be requested.

>**When will funding begin?**
>>The process to distribute funds can begin as soon as funding decisions are made and students begin work.

>**What process will be used to distribute the funds?**
>>A MOU between BNL and the PI of the institute submitting the proposal will be set up.

>**Are students from non-US institutes eligible?**
>>No, the applicants must be enrolled at a US institute with a faculty mentor that is a member of US ATLAS

>**Are non-US citizens eligible?**
>>Yes, as long as they are enrolled at a US institute that participates in US ATLAS

>**What sort of travel can be requested?**
>>If the award is to support travel, it is likely to cover travel to one of the ATCs or to a test beam in the US. Support for travel to CERN is not encouraged, nor are proposals to base SUPER students at CERN encouraged

>**Will there be iteration on the grant request to reduce costs if required?**
>>We expect this will be the case as we expect there to be limited funding available.

>**Can grants be combined with other sources of funding?**
>>Yes, we encourage faculty mentors to investigate support from their home institutions, as well as from their own grants
