title: Frequently Asked Questions
---

>**Who should apply?**
>>The proposal should be submitted by the undergraduate requesting funding after discussion and iterating with a faculty mentor on campus.

>**What form should the applications take**
>>A simple PDF is sufficient. If necessary, the proposals can be written in the form of a Letter of Intent, though the undergraduate should iterate with their mentor in all cases.

>**What will be the process by which the decisions are made?**
>>The proposals will be evaluated on a competitive basis by the US ATLAS Physics Support managers after consulting with the rest of the US ATLAS Operations management team. Proposals will be evaluated in three areas: 1) The merit of the proposed research, 2) The ability of the student to achieve the proposed milestones, 3) A diversity component.

>**What is expected in the final report?**
>>The final report should be 3-4 pages, and include an explanation of the work that was achieved over the course of the summer. Background information should be included, including why the project was important, what obstacles were overcome during the research and prospectives for future work. Clearly labeled plots and tables of numbers with units are encouraged.

>**What is the maximum dollar amount for a given award?**
>>The maximum amount that can be requested for a standard proposal is $6,000. Variances from this amount are to be strictly limited to exceptional circumstances, but are still possible. Note that **this maximum includes all costs**, which should be clearly specified in the budget to be provided by the research mentor.

>**What is the length of time for the project?**
>>The student is expected to dedicate at least 8 weeks to working on the proposed project. Longer (summer) proposals can also be requested.

>**When will funding begin?**
>>The process to distribute funds can begin as soon as funding decisions are made and students begin work, though this work is not expected to start until the summer period, when the student can work on research full-time without taking any classes.

>**What process will be used to distribute the funds?**
>>The stipends are expected to be paid directly to the student via direct deposit to their bank account.

>**Are students from non-US institutes eligible?**
>>No, the applicants must be enrolled at a US institute with a faculty mentor that is a member of US ATLAS.

>**Are non-US citizens eligible?**
>>Yes, as long as they are enrolled at a US institute that participates in US ATLAS

>**Are current students who graduate before the summer eligible?**
>>We don't explicitly exclude recent graduates; however, the aim is to support current undergraduates. Recent graduates who submit a very strong application will be considered, but their graduation date may be held against them during the review.

>**What sort of travel can be requested?**
>>If the award is to support travel, it is likely to cover travel to one of the ATCs or to a test beam in the US. Support for travel to CERN is discouraged, as are proposals to base SUPER students at CERN.

>**Will there be iteration on the grant request to reduce costs if required?**
>>We expect this will be the case as we expect there to be limited funding available.

>**Can grants be combined with other sources of funding?**
>>Yes, we encourage faculty mentors to investigate support from their home institutions, as well as from their own grants
